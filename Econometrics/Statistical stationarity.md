==A _stationary_ time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time.== 

Most statistical forecasting methods are based on the assumption that the time series can be rendered approximately stationary (i.e., "stationarized") through the use of mathematical transformations. 

A stationarized series is relatively easy to predict: you simply predict that its statistical properties will be the same in the future as they have been in the past!  

(Recall our [famous forecasting quotes](https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411quote.htm).)  

The predictions for the stationarized series can then be "untransformed," by reversing whatever mathematical transformations were previously used, to obtain predictions for the original series.
