# Logistic Distribution": 
* It is a [continuous probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_probability_distribution "Continuous probability distribution"). 
* Its [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function "Cumulative distribution function") is the [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function "Logistic function"), which appears in [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression "Logistic regression") and [feedforward neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network "Feedforward neural network"). 
* It resembles the [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution "Normal distribution") in shape but has heavier tails
