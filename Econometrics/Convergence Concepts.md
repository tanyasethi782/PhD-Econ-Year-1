What happens to the sample quantities as the sample size approach to infinity? 

1) Convergence in Probability 
2) Almost Sure Convergence 
3) Convergence in Distribution

Limit Theorems: 

1. LLN: the average of a large number of i.i.d. random variables converges to the expected value.
2. CLT: Under some conditions, the sum of a large number of random variables has an approximately normal distribution.
