# <span class="teal-text">Analogy Principle</span>

Three different ways to estimate the $\beta$ and they are analogous to each other in the case of linear estimation. It is not the case in non-linear estimation.

1. Closed Form Analogy 
2. Extremum Analogy 
3. Moment Equation Analogy 

<span class="teal-text"> Sample Mean in Random Sampling </span> 

* Random Sampling is i.i.d : independent, identically distributed
* Sample Mean Theorem: 
Make the assumption that the population mean and variance exists $\implies$ sample drawn from random sampling (??) $\implies$ 
$E[\bar{Y}] =  \mu_y$ 
$V[\bar{Y}] =  ((\sigma_y)^2)/N$ 

* Gauss Markov Theorem: 

<span class="teal-text"> Small Sample Properties </span> 

If a term in MSE is 0, the smallest variance is of the sample mean.
