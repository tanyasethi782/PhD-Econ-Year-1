a **generalized inverse** (or, **g-inverse**) of an element _x_ is an element _y_ that has some properties of an [inverse element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_element "Inverse element") but not necessarily all of them. The purpose of constructing a generalized inverse of a matrix is to obtain a matrix that can serve as an inverse in some sense for a wider class of matrices than [invertible matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix "Invertible matrix").
