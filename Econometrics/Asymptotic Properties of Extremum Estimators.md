Q(Y, $\theta$) where y is a T-vector of random variables and $\theta$ os a K-vector of parameters. 

==* What is a parameter? ==
```
A parameter is a number describing a whole population (e.g., population mean), while a statistic is a number describing a sample (e.g., sample mean).
```


==Estimator vs Estimate== 
```
* Estimator: Function of the sample. When a sample is taken, an estimator is a function of the rv X_1, ....X_n

* Estimate : Realised value of an estimator ( a number) that is obtained when a sample is actually taken. Realised values: (x_1,..x_n )
