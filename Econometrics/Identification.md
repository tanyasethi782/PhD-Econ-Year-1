Identification: Is $\theta$ unique? 

Identification so far has been if X is a full rank or not. 
If you can't identify $\implies$ even you have P(Y/X) you still could'nt learn the parameter you are interested in 

***
In terms of linear simultaneous equations, we are interested in knowing whether we can uniquely solve $\Pi$$\Gamma$ = $B$
