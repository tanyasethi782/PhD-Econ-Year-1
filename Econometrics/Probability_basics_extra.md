## Uniform Continuity

Pset 1: Q3: 
* Any absolutely continuous function (over a compact interval) is uniformly continuous
* In summary, a function is uniformly continuous if small changes in the input always result in small changes in the output, uniformly across the entire domain.
*  **Uniform Continuity:** Ensures that the function changes slowly and uniformly across the entire domain.
- **Absolute Continuity:** Ensures that the total change of the function over any collection of small intervals is also small, providing a stronger form of control over the function's variation.
