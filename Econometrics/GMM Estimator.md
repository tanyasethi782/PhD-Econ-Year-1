The GMM estimator is typically derived by minimizing a quadratic form of the moment conditions weighted by an optimal weighting matrix.
### Objective Function
The objective function to be minimized in GMM is:
$$
Q(\theta) = g(\theta)' W g(\theta)
$$
This function represents the weighted sum of squared deviations of the moment conditions from their expected value of zero. Minimizing this function with respect to the parameter vector $\theta$ helps in estimating the parameters that align best with the underlying theoretical model.
### General GMM Estimator Formula

The Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator is generally given by the following formula:

$$
\hat{\theta}_{GMM} = \left(\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial g(X, \theta)}{\partial \theta'}\right]' W \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial g(X, \theta)}{\partial \theta'}\right]\right)^{-1} \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial g(X, \theta)}{\partial \theta'}\right]' W \mathbb{E}[g(X, \theta)]
$$

Where:
- $g(X, \theta)$: Vector of moment conditions.
- $W$: Weighting matrix, ideally the inverse of the covariance matrix of the moment conditions for efficiency.
- $\theta$: Parameter vector being estimated.

### Explanation

This formula is used to estimate parameters by minimizing the weighted sum of squared deviations of the moment conditions from zero, where the weights are given by matrix $W$. The choice of $W$ as the inverse of the covariance matrix of the moment conditions ($\Sigma^{-1}$) provides the most efficient estimator under the assumption of normally distributed errors.

### General GMM Minimization Problem

The Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) involves solving a minimization problem where the objective function is the quadratic form of the moment conditions. Here's the general form of the GMM minimization problem:

$$
\hat{\theta}_{GMM} = \arg\min_{\theta} \left\{ g(\theta)' W g(\theta) \right\}
$$

Where:
- $g(\theta)$: Vector of moment conditions, where each element of $g(\theta)$ is expected to be zero under the true parameter value.
- $W$: Weighting matrix, ideally the inverse of the covariance matrix of the moment conditions, $W = \Sigma^{-1}$, to achieve efficiency.
