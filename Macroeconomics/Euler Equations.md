* An Euler equation is a difference or differential equation that is an intertemporal first- order condition for a dynamic choice problem. 
* It describes the evolution of economic variables along an optimal path. 
* It is ==a necessary but not sufficient condition== for a candidate optimal path, and so is useful for partially characterizing the theoretical implications of a range of models for dynamic behavior.==

* Marginal Cost = Marginal Benefit 
	_Many economic problems are dynamic optimization problems in which choices are linked over time, as for example a firm choosing investment over time subject to a convex cost of adjusting its capital stock, or a government deciding tax rates over time subject_to an intertemporal budget constraint. Whatever solution approach one employs — the calculus of variations, optimal control theory or dynamic programming — part of the solution is typically an Euler equation stating that the optimal plan has the property that any marginal, temporary and feasible change in behavior has marginal benefits equal to marginal costs in the present and future._

* Importance of time dimension in EE in Economics 
	==_As in physics, Euler equations in economics are derived from optimization and describe dynamics, but in economics, variables of interest are controlled by forward-looking agents, so that future contingencies typically have a central role in the equations and thus in the dynamics of these variables._==
