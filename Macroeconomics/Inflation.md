# New Keynesian Phillips Curve

$$\pi_t = \beta E_t \pi_{t+1} + \kappa(\hat{y}_t - \hat{y}_t^E)$$

- $\kappa$ treated as deep parameter (degree of price stickiness)
  - $\kappa \approx 0$: little tradeoff
  - $\kappa \gg 0$: large tradeoff
- $\hat{y}_t - \hat{y}_t^E$: output gap

Key Question: When should we be treating this as a structural feature of society? When would it hold even in shocks like the pandemic?
