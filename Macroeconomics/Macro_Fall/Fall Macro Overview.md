| 12 October  | Dynamic Programming | Vlad     | principle of optimality: 1)  Conditions / assumptions 2) statement of the principle. When solution from recursive formulation equate that from the sequential problem. We want to solve the sequential problem and recursive formulation is a tool. This principle proves that it is the right tool. Tip: contrast this with contraction mapping theorem. (I believe these assumptions are an easier way to establish the equivalency. ) | [[Note Oct 12, 2023 (2).pdf]]  |     |

Misc things to remember: 
1) CRS production function for the firm --> Zero profits 
$$ F(\lambda k, \lambda n) = \lambda F(k, n ); 
F'_k k + F'_n n = F(k, n) ; rk + wn = F(k, n)
$$


2) If U is homogenous of any degree, the preferences it represents are homothetic.
