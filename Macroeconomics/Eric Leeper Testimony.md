The U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve are separate entities.
* The Treasury manages all of the money coming into the government and paid out by it.  (so like MoF)
* The Federal Reserve's primary responsibility is to keep the economy stable by managing the supply of money in circulation.
* Security vs municipal bonds
