 expresses the idea that a point of a moving system, either a [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") or a [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process "Stochastic process"), ==will eventually visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense.== 
 
 * This implies that the average behavior of the system can be deduced from the [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(dynamics) "Orbit (dynamics)") of a "typical" point. 
 * ==Equivalently, a sufficiently large collection of random samples from a process can represent the average statistical properties of the entire process.== 
 * Ergodicity is a property of the system; it is a statement that the system cannot be reduced or factored into smaller components.
