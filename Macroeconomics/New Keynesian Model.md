Check what we did for this in Vlad's class // We did neoclassical growth model with Vlad. Understand how this differs from the New Keynesian Model! 

Overview: 

Two main assumptions define the New Keynesian approach to macroeconomics.
* Like the New Classical approach, New Keynesian macroeconomic analysis usually assumes that households and firms have [rational expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_expectations "Rational expectations"). 
* However, the two schools differ in that New Keynesian analysis usually assumes a variety of [market failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure "Market failure"). 
	* ==In particular, New Keynesians assume that there is [imperfect competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperfect_competition "Imperfect competition")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Keynesian_economics#cite_note-1) in price and wage setting to help explain why prices and wages can become "[sticky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_(economics) "Sticky (economics)")", which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.==

Wage and price stickiness, and the other present descriptions of market failures in New Keynesian [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(macroeconomics) "Model (macroeconomics)"), imply that the economy may fail to attain [full employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment "Full employment"). Therefore, New Keynesians argue that macroeconomic stabilization by the government (using [fiscal policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy "Fiscal policy")) and the [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank") (using [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy")) can lead to a more [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency "Pareto efficiency") macroeconomic outcome than a _[laissez faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez_faire "Laissez faire")_ policy would.


# Monopolistic Competition 

![[Session8_slides.pdf]]


## Monopolistic Competition: Equilibrium 
In equilibrium. Additionally, compute equilibrium $N_t$ and $w_t$

$$C^i_t - C_t = Y^i_t = Y_t $$


### Properties: 
* CE is not PO. SPP soln $\neq$ monopolistic equilibrium solution because firms are charging markup because of their mark-up 
* Govt <u>cannot</u> fix this (when Govt can only do taxation and bonds) because the problem comes from market structure and not an externality (In OLG the inefficiency came from the pecuniary externality). You can fix this with subsidy to production, anti-trust etc. 


# New Keynesian Model: 
* Monopolistic Competition
* Nominal bonds 
* Lump-sum taxes
* Calvo Pricing: nominal rigidity (to model price stickiness)
