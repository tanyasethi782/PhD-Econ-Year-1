* Recursive Formulation/ Bellman Equation is the functional equation 




## Theory
* Contraction Mapping Theorem: There is ONE fixed point of operator T 
	* Tv = v 
* Blackwell Theorem: If operator T follows monotocity and discounting, it is a contraction
* Principle of Optimality: 

Principle of Optimality: An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision.

Implication: solution of the sequential problem = solution from the recursive formulation// Recursive formulation leads to the optimal policy solution! 

Assumption 
1) The set of feasible plans is not empty 
2) The sequential Problem is convergent as n goes to infinity 

## Solution

* Method of Indeterminate Coefficients: Guess and Verify 
* FOC of the Value Function --> Euler Equations // envelope theorem (when do we use it?)
