Questions for Jose: 
1) Why do we care for determinacy of the price level? What would it mean if we cant determine the price level?  
2) What is the eigenvalue rule of determinacy?

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Monetary & Fiscal Interactions: Big Picture</span>
- Modeling convention
    - Canonical macro models assume 
        1. MP can and does control inflation
        2. FP can and does ensure solvency  
            1. MP optimal or obeys Taylor-type rule
                - unconstrained or "active"
            2. FP takes MP & private behavior as given and stabilizes debt 
                - constrained or "passive"
- This modeling convention makes sense in normal times
    - embedded in textbooks (Walsh, Woodford, Galí)
- It also makes MP omnipotent & FP trivial

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Price-Level Determination: Big Picture</span>
- Many macroeconomists have only a narrow understanding of how the aggregate price level—and inflation—get determined
    - supply & demand in the "money market" or
    - the Taylor principle for interest-rate setting
    - both are equivalent to MV = PY
- This narrow perspective misses important things 
    - role of nominal government debt
    - payment of interest on reserves  
    - deeper understanding of "determinacy of equilibrium"
- Why focus on price-level determination?
    - monetary & fiscal policies have many other effects
    - Price-level determination is first step 
    - study price-level determination before studying more complicated things
- We are not interested only in inflationary effects of monetary & fiscal policies

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Monetary & Fiscal Interactions: Big Picture</span>
- The "money-only" modeling convention a stretch since 2008
    - What have policies actually been doing?  
        1. MP at or near lower bound—policy rates < 0 in Europe & Japan
        2. FP bouncing between stimulus & austerity
            1. Central banks aggressively pursuing growth
                - thrown Taylor principle out the window
            2. Recent fiscal advice from IMF: 
                - 2008–2009: urgent need to stimulate
                - 2010–2011: urgent need to consolidate  
                - 2012: urgent need for stimulative consolidation ("growsterity")
    - How can such policies anchor monetary expectations on inflation target?
    - How can such policies anchor fiscal expectations on debt stabilization?

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Monetary & Fiscal Interactions: Big Picture</span>
- Need to understand implications of policy interactions that deviate from convention
    - Short-run reasons:
        - European countries & Japan mired in "low-flation"; many advanced & emerging economies have high government debt
        - Ubiquitous tradeoff between macroeconomic stabilization & fiscal sustainability
        - What are effect of fiscal policy when MP pegs rate?
    - Long-run reasons:
        - Aging populations & unfunded old-age benefits
        - Huge uncertainty about future fiscal policies
        - What are impacts of unresolved long-run fiscal stress?
- Conventional modeling cannot address these issues
    - assumes away the problems

1. Effects of monetary policy—open-market operations— depend on the sense in which fiscal policy is "held constant"  
2. Effects of fiscal policy—bond-financed tax cuts—depend on the sense in which monetary policy is "held constant"
3. ==MP cannot uniquely determine inflation; FP can==
4. ==MP can uniquely determine bounded inflation—if FP cooperates==
5. If FP does not cooperate, MP cannot affect economy in usual ways
6. Without credible, enforceable fiscal rules that anchor expectations on appropriate FP behavior, fiscal disturbances always affect economy

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">General Points About Inflation</span>

Summary: ==Govt can soak up excess currency by 1) taxes, 2) Nominal bonds ==
- Why does fiat currency have value?
    - Because the government accepts currency—and only currency—in payment of taxes
- Inflation arises when government prints more currency than it eventually absorbs in taxes
    - people try to get rid of currency & buy things
    - pushes up prices & wages
- Government can soak up currency by selling bonds
    - does this when it spends more—handing out currency—than it taxes—soaking up currency
- Nominal bonds—like fiat currency—are promises to pay back more currency in future
    - ==If government doesn't soak up bonds with taxes... inflation==

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">General Points About Inflation</span>
- Just as money gets its value from taxes...
    - Monetary policy gets its power from fiscal backing
- When fiscal backing is assured, MP operates as taught in textbooks
    - MP can control inflation
    - higher interest rates—open-market sale of bonds—reduce consumption & inflation
- ==But only if future taxes rise to soak up bonds==
    - higher taxes eliminate the wealth effects of higher interest payments on government debt
- Otherwise, higher rates...
    - raises wealth, reduce value of bonds, increase aggregate demand & inflation
- It's all about fiscal backing

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Two Kinds of Government Debt</span>
1. Real debt: denominated in "goods"
    - arises whenever debt is in units whose quantity the government cannot control
    - indexed to inflation; foreign currency; gold
    - in most countries today only small fraction of debt is real
    - indexed debt is like debt under the Gold Standard, where governments did not control the price level
    - a claim to goods in the future 
    - government must acquire those goods to honor obligations
    - ==can acquire goods through taxes or money creation (seigniorage)==
    - if it cannot acquire the goods, default only option

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Two Kinds of Government Debt</span>
2. ==Nominal debt: denominated in home currency ("dollars")==
    - arises whenever debt is in units whose supply the government can control
    - vast majority of government debt is of this kind
    - a claim to "dollars" in the future
    - government need not be able to acquire goods
    - it can print new "dollars" to reduce market value of debt ("dollars" can be new debt instruments—not necessarily currency)
    - default less likely
- This distinction carries important policy implications

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Two Kinds of Government Debt</span>
- E.A. countries don't control their monetary policy
    - to each country, debt in euros is real debt
- Default on real debt more likely: euro rates embed default premium

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Policy Authority's Budget Identities</span>
- Fiscal authority
$$B_t = (1 + i_t^B)B_{t-1} - P_t S_t - P_t Z_t$$
S: primary surplus; Z: remittances from CB
- Monetary authority
$$B_t^{CB} + P_t Z_t = (1 + i_t^B) B_{t-1}^{CB} + M_t - M_{t-1} + R_t - (1 + i_{t-1}^R)R_{t-1}$$
R: bank reserves; M: fiat currency
- Bonds held by public
$$B_t^p = B_t - B_t^{CB}$$
- Two interest-bearing nominal liabilities—$B$ & $R$—one non-interest-bearing—$M$

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Policy Authority's Budget Identities</span>
- What links FA & MA identities?
$$B_t = (1 + i_t^B)B_{t-1} - P_t S_t - P_t Z_t$$
$$B_t^{CB} + P_t Z_t = (1 + i_t^B) B_{t-1}^{CB} + M_t - M_{t-1} + R_t - (1 + i_{t-1}^R)R_{t-1}$$
- Do these constrain fiscal & monetary choices? Why? Why not?

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Consolidated Government Budget Identity</span>
$$B_t^P + R_t + P_t S_t + M_t - M_{t-1} = (1 + i_{t-1}^B)B_{t-1}^P + (1 + i_{t-1}^R)R_{t-1}$$
S: primary surplus;
R: bank reserves; 
M: fiat currency

- Does this constrain the "consolidated government's" choices? 
- At beginning of $t$, total nominal government liabilities are
$$(1 + i_{t-1}^B)B_{t-1}^P + (1 + i_{t-1}^R)R_{t-1} + M_{t-1}$$
- With this bigger picture in mind, turn to a model

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">The Model</span>

Key Point: ==Without additional restrictions from policy behavior, there are many possible eqm $\{P_t\}$ sequences

- Endowment economy at the cashless limit; complete financial markets, one-period nominal debt
- Representative household maximizes
$$E_0 \left( \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t U(C_t) \right)$$
subject to sequence of flow budget constraints
$$P_t C_t + P_t \tau_t + E_t [Q_{t,t+1} B_t] = P_t Y_t + P_t z_t + B_{t-1}$$
given $B_{-1} > 0$
    - $Q_{t,t+1}$: nominal price at $t$ of an asset that pays $1 at $t + 1$
    - $m_{t+1}$: real contingent claims price
    - $Q_{t,t+1} = \beta \frac{P_t}{P_{t+1}} m_{t,t+1}$: no-arbitrage condition
    - Nominal interest rate, $R_t$: $\frac{1}{R_t} = E_t [Q_{t,t+1}]$


- Can write HH's real intertemporal b.c. as
$$E_t \sum_{j=0}^\infty m_{t,t+j} C_{t+j} = \frac{B_{t-1}}{P_t} + E_t \sum_{j=0}^\infty m_{t,t+j} (Y_{t+j} - s_{t+j})$$
$$s_t \equiv \tau_t - z_t$$
    - $m_{t,t+j} \equiv \prod_{k=0}^j \beta m_{t,t+k}$ is real discount factor, $m_{t,t} = 1$
- HH choices also satisfy the transversality condition
$$\lim_{T \to \infty} E_t \left[ \beta m_{t,T} \frac{B_T}{P_T} \right] = 0$$
- It is not optimal for HHs to overaccumulate assets

- Impose equilibrium, $C_t = Y$, and TVC to get two eqm conditions
$$\frac{1}{R_t} = E_t \frac{P_t}{P_{t+1}} \equiv E_t \frac{1}{\pi_{t+1}} \quad \text{(Fisher relation)}$$
$$\frac{B_{t-1}}{P_t} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^j E_t s_{t+j} \quad \text{(Bond valuation)}$$
$$s_t \equiv \tau_t - z_t \quad \text{(We assume } 0 < E_t \text{PV}(s) < \infty \text{)}$$
- Price sequence $\{P_t\}$ must satisfy these to be an eqm (markets clear & HH's optimization problem solved)
- ==Without additional restrictions from policy behavior, there are many possible eqm $\{P_t\}$ sequences==

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Interpreting "Bond Valuation"</span>
- Substitute (Bond valuation) into HH's budget constraint
$$C_t + \tau_t + \frac{1}{R_t} \frac{B_t}{P_t} = Y_t + z_t + \frac{B_{t-1}}{P_t}$$
- Imposing Euler & goods market clearing yields demand for bonds 
$$B_t^d = P_t R_t \sum_{j=1}^\infty \beta^j E_t s_{t+j} \quad \text{(Bond demand)}$$
- Nominal bond demand is...
    - homogeneous degree 1 in $P_t$
    - declining in price of bond, $1/R_t$
    - increasing in PV cash flows (primary surpluses)

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">The Model</span>
- Cashless economy: $1/P_t$ is goods price of nominal bond; $1/R_t$ is dollar price of bond
- Ad hoc policy rules
$$\text{MP: } \frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{1}{R^*} + \alpha \left( \frac{1}{\pi_t} - \frac{1}{\pi^*} \right)
+ \varepsilon_t^M$$
$$\text{FP: } s_t = s^* + \gamma \left( \frac{1}{R_{t-1}} \frac{B_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} - \frac{b^*}{R^*} \right) + \varepsilon_t^F$$
- Combine rules with Euler equation & government budget constraint to yield dynamic equations in $\nu_t \equiv 1/\pi_t$ and $b_t \equiv B_t / P_t$

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Separate Dynamics?</span>
$$E_t (\nu_{t+1} - \nu^*) = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} (\nu_t - \nu^*) + \frac{1}{\beta} \varepsilon_t^M$$
$$E_t \left( \frac{b_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}} - \frac{b^*}{R^*} \right) = (\beta^{-1} - \gamma) \left( \frac{b_t}{R_t} - \frac{b^*}{R^*} \right) - E_t \varepsilon_{t+1}^F$$
- Appears as if 
    - inflation dynamics driven only by MP through $(\alpha, \varepsilon_t^M)$
    - debt dynamics driven only by FP through $(\gamma, \varepsilon_t^F)$
- Regime M: $|\alpha/\beta| > 1$ & $|\beta^{-1} - \gamma| < 1$
- Regime F: $|\alpha/\beta| < 1$ & $|\beta^{-1} - \gamma| > 1$
- In either regime, in equilibrium policies interact to determine inflation & stabilize debt

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Two Tasks of Policy</span>
- Monetary & fiscal policy have two tasks: (1) control inflation; (2) stabilize debt
- Two different policy mixes that can accomplish these tasks
    - Regime M: conventional assignment—MP targets inflation; FP targets real debt (called active MP/passive FP)
    - Regime F: alternative assignment—MP maintains value of debt; FP controls inflation (called passive MP/active FP)
- Regime M: conventional "monetarist/new Keynesian"
- Regime F: alternative "fiscal theory"

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime M</span>
- Bounded solution: only MP shocks cause $\pi_t \neq \pi^*$
$$\nu_t = \nu^* - \frac{1}{\alpha} \sum_{j=0}^\infty \left( \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \right)^j E_t \varepsilon_{t+j}^M$$
$$\frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{1}{R^*} - \beta \sum_{j=1}^\infty \left( \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \right)^j E_t \varepsilon_{t+j}^M$$
- Equilibrium inflation appears to depend only on monetary policy
    - policy parameter: $\alpha$
    - policy shock: $\varepsilon_t^M$
- Fiscal policy does not seem to matter
- Delivers Friedman: "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime M</span>

- What is the fiscal backing for monetary policy?
    - passive FP: $\gamma > \beta^{-1} - 1$ (net real interest rate) covers debt service & retires debt
    - assume $\varepsilon_t^M \sim \text{i.i.d.}$ and $\varepsilon_t^M > 0$
    - raises $P_t$, reduces real value of outstanding bonds, $B_{t-1}/P_t$, & market value of debt, $B_t/R_t P_t$
    - if $s_{t+j}$ unchanged, reduced real debt gets passed into lower nominal debt growth
    - eventually, people will realize their wealth has declined and reduce their demand for goods
    - lower demand will reduce price level, counteracting MP
    - if lower real debt is backed by lower $s_{t+j}$, fiscal policy eliminates the negative wealth effect
    - this fiscal backing permits monetary policy to control inflation in the usual way
    - this is the definition of passive fiscal policy

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime M</span>
- Friedman's adage requires an addendum: "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, so long as FP eliminates wealth effects of policy"
- As Tobin put it: "Ricardian equivalence is fundamental, perhaps indispensable, to monetarism"
- Consider an i.i.d. tax cut: $\varepsilon_t^F < 0$
    - has no effect on inflation or nominal interest rate
    - financed by higher $B_t$ $\implies$ higher $b_t$
    - passive FP: higher future $\{s_{t+j}\}$
    - $b_t \to b^*$
    - delivers neutrality of tax-debt swaps
- Passive FP achieves two things:
    1. Stabilizes real debt
    2. Provides appropriate fiscal backing to MP

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime M Equilibrium</span>
- Unique bounded equilibrium inflation rate
- Stable process for government debt
- But... also a continuum of equilibria with $\lim_{T \to \infty} \pi_T = \infty$
- Neither MP nor private behavior rules out equilibria with $\pi_t = \infty$
- This (minor?) anomaly or embarrassment can be resolved only by fiscal policy

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime M's Explosive Solutions</span>
- Examine perfect foresight; generalize policy rule
$$R_t = \frac{1}{\pi_{t+1}}$$
$$R_t = \tilde{\phi}(\pi_t)$$
- Solution satisfies non-linear difference equation
$$\pi_{t+1} = \phi(\pi_t)$$
- Two steady states: $\pi^*$ and $\pi^L$
- $\pi^L$ are zero lower bound for nominal interest rate

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime M's Explosive Solutions</span>


<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime F</span>
- Take case of exogenous surpluses, $\gamma = 0$
- Solve for market value of debt, $b_t / R_t$, & use GBC
$$P_t = \frac{B_{t-1}}{(1 - \beta)^{-1} s^* + \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^j E_t \varepsilon_{t+j}^F}$$
- only FP—including $B_{t-1}$—appears to matter
- Increase in current or expected transfers
    - no offsetting taxes expected, household wealth rises
    - lower expected path of surpluses reduces "cash flows," lowers value of debt
    - individuals shed debt in favor of consumption, raising aggregate demand
    - higher current & future inflation and economic activity
    - long bonds shift inflation into future
- Demand for debt $\downarrow$, aggregate demand $\uparrow$

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime F</span>
- How does monetary policy stabilize debt?
$$E_t \left( \frac{b_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}} - \frac{b^*}{R^*} \right) = \frac{1}{\beta} \left( \frac{b_t}{R_t} - \frac{b^*}{R^*} \right)$$
- debt dynamics: $b_t / R_t$ expected to grow at $\beta^{-1}$
    - this appears to violate the transversality condition, which implies cannot be an equilibrium
- MP stabilizes $b_t / R_t$ by preventing interest payments from exploding
    - appears as surprises in $P_t$ that revalue debt
- MP accomplishes this through its interest-rate policy
- Show this for i.i.d. $\varepsilon^F$ $\implies$ $b_{t+j} / R_{t+j}$ constant

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime F</span>
- Use expression for $\nu_t$ in MP rule
$$\frac{1}{R_t} - \frac{1}{R^*} = -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \left( \frac{(1 - \beta)s^* + \varepsilon_t^F}{b_{t-1}} - \frac{1}{R^*} \right) + \varepsilon_t^M$$
- Fiscal expansion: $\varepsilon_t^F < 0$
    - MP reduces $1/R_t$ by $(\alpha/\beta b_{t-1}) \varepsilon_t^F$ to fight inflation
    - i.i.d. shock $\implies$ $b_t / R_t = b^* / R^*$
    - at $t + 1$, interest rate obeys
    $$\frac{1}{R_{t+1}} - \frac{1}{R^*} = -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \left( \frac{1}{R_t} - \frac{1}{R^*} \right)$$  
    - if MP were active, $\alpha/\beta > 1$, $1/R_t$ diverges
    - exploding paths due to wealth effects from ever-growing interest payments to bond holders
    - higher wealth $\implies$ higher $\pi_{t+1}$ $\implies$ higher $R_{t+1}$ etc.
    - active MP converts stable fiscal inflation into explosive inflation

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Regime F</span>
- Monetary policy rule implies
$$\frac{1}{R_t} - \frac{1}{R^*} = -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \left( \frac{(1 - \beta)s^* + \varepsilon_t^F}{b_{t-1}} - \frac{1}{R^*} \right) + \varepsilon_t^M$$
- fiscal expansion, $\varepsilon_t^F < 0$, financed with higher $B_t$
    - if MP pegs $R_t = R^*$, it fixes future inflation by fixing interest payments that fiscal expansion would raise
- MP contraction, $\varepsilon_t^M < 0$, lowers $1/R_t$, raises interest payments
    - FP does not raise surpluses to eliminate this wealth effect
    - if future inflation were not to rise, nominal debt would grow
    - raises wealth still more, so eventually inflation must increase
- these different MP impacts arise from the different "fiscal backing" of MP

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">An Equilibrium Condition</span>
$$\frac{B_{t-1}}{P_t} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^j E_t [s_{t+j}]$$
- In Regime M...
    - MP delivers equilibrium inflation process
    - taking inflation as given, FP must choose compatible surplus policy
    - "compatible" means: stabilizes debt & passively provides appropriate fiscal backing
    - imposes restrictions on $E_t \text{PV}(s)$

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">An Equilibrium Condition</span>
$$\frac{B_{t-1}}{P_t} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^j E_t [s_{t+j}]$$
- In Regime F...
    - FP delivers unique equilibrium price process
    - taking inflation as given, MP must choose compatible interest rate policy
    - "compatible" means: stabilizes debt
    - imposes restrictions on $P_t$ (& on MP, if price level to remain stable)

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">More on the Equilibrium Condition</span>
$$\frac{B_{t-1}}{P_t} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^j E_t [s_{t+j}]$$
- Ubiquitous: holds in any model, in any regime
    - cannot be used to "test" for regime
- It is not an "intertemporal government budget constraint"
    - have imposed market clearing, Euler equations, transversality (from private behavior)
    - Government is not restricted to choose $\{s_t\}$ to satisfy it for any $\{P_t\}$ (but it is free to do so)
- Cochrane calls it a "debt valuation equation"
    - with only one-period debt, $B_{t-1}/P_t$ is market value of debt

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Primer on Monetary-Fiscal Interactions</span>
- Unpleasant monetarist arithmetic
    - economy hits the fiscal limit
    - surpluses unresponsive to debt
    - seigniorage adjusts to stabilize debt
    - produces high & volatile inflation
- Many countries have guarded against this
    - central bank independence
    - clear mandate to control inflation—e.g., inflation targeting
- Designed to force FP to be passive
- Will focus on second way Regime F can arise

<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## <span class="dark-mustard-text">Primer on Monetary-Fiscal Interactions</span>
- Monetary & fiscal policy have two tasks: (1) control inflation; (2) stabilize debt
- Beautiful symmetry: two different policy mixes that can accomplish these tasks
    - Regime M: conventional assignment—MP targets inflation; FP targets real debt (called active MP/passive FP)
    - Regime F: alternative assignment—MP maintains value of debt; FP controls inflation (called passive MP/active FP)
- Regime M: normal state of affairs
- Regime F: can arise in an era of fiscal stress
- Regime F arises in two ways
    1. fiscal theory of the price level
    2. Sargent & Wallace's unpleasant monetarist arithmetic
