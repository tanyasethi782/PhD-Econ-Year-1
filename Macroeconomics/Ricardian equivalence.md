The **Ricardian equivalence proposition** (also known as the **Ricardo–de Viti–Barro equivalence theorem**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_equivalence#cite_note-buchanan76-1)) is an [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic "Economic") hypothesis holding that consumers are forward-looking and so internalize the government's [budget constraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_constraint "Budget constraint") when making their consumption decisions. This leads to the result that, for a given pattern of government spending, the method of financing such spending does not affect agents' consumption decisions, and thus, it does not change [aggregate demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand "Aggregate demand").
