* Transversality conditions are optimality conditions often used along with Euler equations to characterize the optimal paths (plans, programs, trajectories, etc) of dynamic economic models.

* If the terminal (or initial) point is not fixed, there may be many paths satisfying the Euler equation. ==A transversality condition enables one to single out the optimal path among those satisfying the Euler equation, or at least to rule out some non-optimal paths.==

* Example: (But here it seems like just another condition which could be anything depending on the scenario :0 )
A simple geometric example best illustrates the roles of an Euler equation and a transversality condition. What is the shortest path from a point A to a straight line L infinitely long in both directions? The answer is of course the straight line from point A to line L that is perpendicular to line L. There are two conditions involved here. The first condition is that the shortest path be a straight line: one cannot make the path shorter by deviating from it and eventually returning to it. This is the implication of the Euler equation for this problem. But there are infinitely many straight lines from point A to line L. In fact, a straight line from point A to line L can be arbitrarily long, so that even very bad choices satisfy the Euler equation. This is why one needs the second condition, that the shortest path be perpendicular to line L. This additional condition ensures that one cannot make the path shorter by deviating from it and never returning to it.


## No-Ponzi-game conditions and transversality conditions

In formulating a consumerâ€™s problem, one must include some constraint on debt, since otherwise the consumer would never pay back his debt, letting it grow unboundedly. One way to rule out this behavior is to prohibit debt entirely, i.e., to require wealth to be always nonnegative. A more lenient way is to require only the present discounted value of wealth at infinity to be nonnegative. This type of condition is known as a no-Ponzi-game condi- tion (Blanchard and Fischer, 1989, p. 49), but often called a transversality condition as well. A no-Ponzi-game condition is a constraint that prevents overaccumulation of debt, while a transversality condition is an optimality condition that rules out overaccumulation of wealth. ==They place opposite restrictions, and should not be confused.==
