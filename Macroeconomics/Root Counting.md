* Jump Variables Vs State Variables  
n macroeconomic models, whether a variable is considered a jump (forward-looking) or a state (backward-looking) variable fundamentally depends on how its future expectations influence its current level. State variables typically incorporate historical and current data, and although they might be affected by random shocks, they still primarily reflect past and present information unless the decision-making related to those variables directly incorporates future expectations.

* Define K: 
Number of eigenvalues of the model that lie outside the interval [-1,1]
!! Make sure you understand how to read off eigenvalues from a system 
 
* Root Counting/ Blanchard-Kahn Conditions: 
	If K = J $\implies$ unique solution 
	If K > J $\implies$ no bounded solution 
	If K < J $\implies$ infinite number of solutions
