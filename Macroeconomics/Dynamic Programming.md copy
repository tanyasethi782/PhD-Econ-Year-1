Contraction Mapping Theorem; Blackwell Theorem | ![[Note Oct 10, 2023.pdf]]

principle of optimality: 1)  Conditions / assumptions 2) statement of the principle. 

When solution from recursive formulation equate that from the sequential problem. We want to solve the sequential problem and recursive formulation is a tool. This principle proves that it is the right tool. Tip: contrast this with contraction mapping theorem. (I believe these assumptions are an easier way to establish the equivalency. )
