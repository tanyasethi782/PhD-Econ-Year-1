* CRS Production: 
	* Factors: K, L
	* Goods: Manufacturing and Food (M,F)
	* Imp: endowments in factors of production 

# $\pi$ problem: 
* $\pi$ maximization problem for food: max $pF(L,K) - wL - rK$
* Value of the marginal product FOCs:
	* Isoquant slope = MRTS 
* Isocost line (firms don't have budget lines) and Isoquant
* Put 1$ on isoquant $\implies$ $\frac{1}{P_F}$ isoquant (?) 
* Capital Labor Line (K/L): passes through the origin and the intersection of isocost and isoquant 
* We are assuming that manufacturing is capital intensive relative to food production $\implies$ food is relatively labor intensive 
	* Manufacaturing line is steeper than for food production (which line?) // I think isoquant 

# Factor Price Frontier 
* Factor Price Frontier: Given something, you can find factors when deployed optimally that lead to 0 profit

# Diversification 
* Supporting Wage Rental Ratio consistent with economy producing <u>both of the goods </u>  given the endowments 
* Zero Profits (?)
* When does diversification exist? 
	* Between the cone of $\Delta$ K and $\Delta$ F  

# <u>Factor price equalization theorem:</u> 

Summary: **Factor price equalization** is an [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") theory, by [Paul A. Samuelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_A._Samuelson "Paul A. Samuelson") (1948), which states that the prices of identical [factors of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production "Factors of production"), such as the wage rate or the rent of capital, will be equalized across countries as a result of international trade in commodities. 

Assumptions: 
* there are two goods and two factors of production, for example capital and labour. 
* Other key assumptions of the theorem are that each country faces the same commodity prices, because of free trade in commodities, uses the same technology for production, and produces both goods.

// Check what are the required assumptions. The above is from wiki. CRS/homotheticity of some kind

Economy's factor prices are the same as any other economy lying in the cone 
	* Economies in cone have same w/r $\implies$ Incomplete Specialization  
	* Outside the cone $\implies$ Specialize 


Graph: 
* Isoquant slopes = $\frac{1}{P_m}$; $\frac{1}{P_f}$
* 1 $ Isocost line: -$\frac{w}{r}$
* Capital labor ratio lines $k_m$; $k_f$

Production Function is going to be concave (proof in the handout)

* Planner's Problem: maximize value of production at world prices  


# Rybsczinsky Theorem 

Magnification Theorem: 
* Suppose one economy has more proportionate labor that other, the economy with the more labor has more than proportionate change in labor intensive good 
* % change L = $\frac{\Delta L}{L}$
% change F> % change  L>  % change K > % change M 

* Slides: Give the intuition behind it. I got it. 
# Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem 

* Backed by Rybsczinsky Theorem

# Integrated Economy: Krugman 
Trade in goods substitutes for trade in factors (you don't need to have explicit migration)

# Stopler Samuelson Theorem 

It describes the relationship between relative prices of output and relative factor goods.
