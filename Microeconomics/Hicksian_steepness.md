Why is the hicksian demand curve steeper than the walrasian demand curve for a normal good?

MicroEcon

Great question! The comparison between Hicksian (compensated) and Walrasian (ordinary) demand curves in the context of normal goods is a classic topic in microeconomics. Let's break it down:

1. **Hicksian Demand Curve**: This curve represents how a consumer's choice of goods changes in response to price changes while keeping utility constant. It's derived by adjusting the consumer's income so they can reach the same level of utility they had before the price change.
    
2. **Walrasian Demand Curve**: Also known as the ordinary or Marshallian demand curve, this shows how a consumer's choice of goods changes in response to price changes without any adjustment to their income.
    

Now, for a normal good, as the price decreases, the consumer not only substitutes towards the cheaper good (substitution effect) but also enjoys an increase in real income (income effect), leading to an increase in the consumption of the good. The Walrasian demand curve accounts for both these effects.

In contrast, the Hicksian demand curve isolates the substitution effect by holding utility constant. It compensates the consumer for the change in real income due to the price change.

For normal goods, the income effect works in the same direction as the substitution effect. Therefore, when comparing the two curves:

- The Hicksian demand curve is steeper because it only reflects the substitution effect. It doesn't include the additional quantity demanded due to the income effect, which is present in the Walrasian demand curve.
- The Walrasian demand curve is flatter because it combines both the substitution and income effects. Since both effects increase demand for a normal good as its price falls, the Walrasian curve shows a more significant increase in quantity demanded for a given price decrease.

In essence, the difference in the steepness of these curves for a normal good is due to the absence (in the Hicksian curve) or presence (in the Walrasian curve) of the income effect.
