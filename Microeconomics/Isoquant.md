 * The contour line of an isoquant represents every combination of two inputs which ==fully maximise a firms’ use of resources==(such as budget, or time).

* <u>Cardinal instead of ordinal </u>
While an [indifference curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference_curve "Indifference curve") mapping helps to solve the utility-maximizing problem of consumers, the isoquant mapping deals with the cost-minimization and profit and output maximisation problem of producers. Indifference curves further differ to isoquants, in that they cannot offer a precise measurement of utility, only how it is relevant to a baseline. Whereas, from an isoquant, the product can be measured accurately in physical units, and it is known by exactly how much isoquant 1 exceeds isoquant 2.

* Slope = MRTS 
isoquants by nature are downward sloping due to operation of diminishing [marginal rates of technical substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_rate_of_technical_substitution "Marginal rate of technical substitution") (MRTS). The slope of an isoquant represents the rate at which input x can be substituted for input y.
Thus, the steeper the isoquant, the higher the MRTS. Since MRTS must diminish, isoquants must be convex to their origin. 
Adding one input while holding the other constant eventually leads to decreasing marginal output.

* <u>Unit isoquant</u>
Unit Isoquant of firm j is corresponding to $f(z_{j1}, z_{j2})=1$, where $z_{i}$ are factors of production.
