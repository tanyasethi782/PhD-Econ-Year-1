1) Rationality Assumptions 
* Completeness 
* Transitivity 

2) Desirability Assumptions 
larger amounts of commodities are preferred to less amounts of commodities. 
* Monotonicity 
* Local non-satiation 
If preference is monotone, then it implies LNS. 

3) Convexity Assumptions 
If y$\geq$x & z$\geq$x, then $\alpha y$ + (1-$\alpha$)z $\geq$x for alpha in [0, 1]
In words, A preference relation on X in convex, if for every x in X, the upper contour set {$y \in X: y \geq x$ } in convex. 

Implications: 
* 1) Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution: More and more of good 2 is required to compensate for loss of each unit of good 1 
* 2) Diversification: Prefer a combination of x and y than just x or y i.e. if x ~ y then, 1/2(x) + 1/2(y)>~ x or y. 

* Strong Convexity 
If y$\geq$x & z$\geq$x, then $\alpha y$ + (1-$\alpha$)z > x

### Two special kind of preferences: 

The preferences listed below let economists deduce the entire range of consumer's preference relations by *a single indifference curve*: 

#### Homothetic Preferences: If x~y, then $\alpha x$ ~ $\alpha y$
*All the indifference curves are blown up version of each other/ related by proportional expansion along rays*

#### [[Quasilinear]] Preferences 

$\geq$ on X ($-\infty, \infty$) is quasilinear w.r.t commodity 1 
<span class="orange-text"> ! Notice how it is quasilinear wrt a commodity. </span>
<span class="orange-text">! Notice that there is no lower bar to X. </span>

 1)  If x~y, then $(x + \alpha e_{i})$ ~ ($y + \alpha e_{i}$)
 All the ICs are parallel displacement along the axis of commodity 1.

2) Good 1 is desirable. 
$(x + \alpha e_{i}) > x$

Other Preferences: 
#### Leontif Preferences 
$x \geq y$ if Min{$x_1, x_2$} $\geq$ Min{$y_1, y_2$}
	* ICs are L shaped with kinks 
	* Utility functions are non-differentiable (An assumption we use for convenience)

#### Lexicographic Preferences 
Define $x \ge y$ if either $x_{1} > y_{1}$ or $x_{1} = y_{1}$ &  $x_{2} \ge y_{2}$  
* Good 1 has the highest priority in determining the preference ordering. When the level of first commodity in two commodity bundles is the same, the amount of the second commodity in the two bundles determines the consumer's preferences. 
* It is rational (complete, transitive), strongly monotone and strictly convex. 
* Lexicographic preferences are not continuous. 
* Cannot be expressed by utility functions. 
* No two unique consumption bundles are indifferent (<span class="orange-text"> ! Because it's no longer about the combinations of two goods that provide the same utility; we always have strict inequalities between the goods </span>)  $\implies$ <u>Indifference curves are singletons. </u>
	* <span class="red-text">!So what?? </span>
