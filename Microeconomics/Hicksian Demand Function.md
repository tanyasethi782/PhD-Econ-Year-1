In [microeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics "Microeconomics"), a consumer's **Hicksian demand function** or **compensated demand function** for a good is his quantity demanded as part of the solution to [minimizing his expenditure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_minimization_problem "Expenditure minimization problem") on all goods while delivering a fixed level of [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility "Utility"). Essentially, a **Hicksian demand function** shows how an economic agent would react to the change in the price of a good, if the agent's income was compensated to guarantee the agent the same utility previous to the change in the price of the good—the agent will remain on the same indifference curve before and after the change in the price of the good. The function is named after [John Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hicks "John Hicks").

where _h_(_p_,_u_) is the Hicksian demand function, or commodity bundle demanded, at price vector _p_ and utility level �¯![{\bar {u}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d707dfa8c7f2c1d6635efa659a22efb3c71e8f4). Here _p_ is a vector of prices, and _x_ is a vector of quantities demanded, so the sum of all _p__i__x__i_ is total expenditure on all goods. (Note that if there is more than one vector of quantities that minimizes expenditure for the given utility, we have a Hicksian demand [correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1:1_correspondence "1:1 correspondence") rather than a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)").)

Hicksian demand functions are useful for isolating the effect of relative prices on quantities demanded of goods, in contrast to [Marshallian demand functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshallian_demand_function "Marshallian demand function"), which combine that with the effect of the real income of the consumer being reduced by a price increase, as explained below.
