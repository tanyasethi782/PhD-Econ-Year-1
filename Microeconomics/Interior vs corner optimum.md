Also referred to as an interior optimum. In the context of a constrained optimization problem this is a solution that changes in response to any arbitrarily small perturbation to the gradient of the objective function at the optimum. 

If the optimal solution does not change for at least one direction of such a perturbation it is said to be a corner solution, or a corner optimum.
