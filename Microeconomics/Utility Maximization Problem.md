## <span class = "teal-text"> UMP  </span>
* If p>0 and u(.) is continuous $\implies$ sol to UMP exists 
* We find Walrasian Demand Function and the indirect utility function

x(p,w) 

* To find x(p,w), set UMP i.e. Max u(x) s.t. $p.x \geq w$
* Properties: 
	* HD-0 
	* Fulfills walras law 
	* $\geq$ is convex $\implies$ u(.) is quasiconcave $\implies$ x(p,w) is a convex set 
	*  $\geq$ is strictly convex $\implies$ u(.) is strictly quasiconcave $\implies$ x(p,w) is a singleton (i..e is unique and thus the walrasian dd correspondence is a function in that case)
			<span class = "orange-text">*so strict convexity of preferences is required for a unique demand function*</span> 
			<span class = "red-text">*have to study what convexity/ quasiconcavity mean*</span> 
		
	
	
### Marginal Rate of Substitution 
* Owing to the Kuhn Tucker 
* For interior solutions:
	{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_l} / {\frac{\partial u }{\partial x_k} = p_l/p_k$
* For corner solutions: this does not need to hold. 
	* Need to understand this as I practice questions 

### Lagrangian 
* Is equal to the consumer's marginal utility if wealth at the optimum

## <span class = "teal-text">Indirect Utility Function </span>

Definition: The utility value of the UMP, denoted by $v(p,w) = u(x^{*})$, where $x^{*} \in x(p,w)$
* Properties: 
	* HD-0 (If p&w both increase, no change in v(.) )
	* Strictly increasing in w and non-increasing in p 
	* Quasi-convex (In contrast, U(.) is quasi-concave) 
	* Continuous in p & w 

* Just plug in the values of $x^*$  in the function $u(.)$ to obtain $v(.)$
