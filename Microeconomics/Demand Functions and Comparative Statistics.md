### <span class="teal-text"> 1) Correspondence vs function  </span> 

 * x(p,w) is correspondence st every p,w combination is linked to x vector. 
* When the above is single valued, it is a demand function. (As we studied the definition of a function, a unique matching b/e values in domain and co-domain)

### <span class="teal-text"> 2) Assumptions for the Walrasian Demand Correspondence  </span>

* It is HD-0 :  X($\alpha$p, $\alpha$w) = x(p,w)
Interpretation: If p and w change in the same proportion, then the demand X does not change. <span class="orange-text"> Yes, because no substitution or income effects.  </span>

*  Satisfies walras law. 
### <span class="teal-text"> 3) Wealth Effect  </span>

* <span class="orange-text"> Consumer's Engel Function </span> $x(\overline{p}, w)$ : Change in x as w changes. 
	
	Wealth Effect for a good: $\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial w}$
	
	### <span class="red-text"> !! Note: Read more about the difference b/w partial and total derivates. I have forgotten it.  </span> #Ques #Micro

* Normal Goods
	$\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial w} >=0$
	X increases as w increases 
* Inferior Goods 
	$\frac{\partial x(p,w)}{\partial w} <0$
	X decreases as w increases 

### <span class="teal-text"> 4) Price Effect  </span>

* Price Effect of p_k: 
	$\frac{\partial x_l(p,w)}{\partial p_k}$: Change in x_l as p_k changes 
* Giffen Good $\frac{\partial x_l(p,w)}{\partial p_l} > 0$

### <span class="teal-text"> 5) Elasticities  </span> 
 <span class="orange-text"> Important, I got confused about the formula in the finals </span>


* By definition: 
Price Elasticity (Similarly for wealth)
e = $\frac{(\partial x)p}{(\partial p)x}$

* Logarithmic definition of elasticity:
 `e<sub>i</sub>`= $\frac{d log x_i}{d log \theta}$

  <span class="orange-text"> Useful to use when the expression for x is long and complicated </span>
    <span class="red-text"> Q: How is the logarithmic definition equivalent? </span> #Ques #Micro
