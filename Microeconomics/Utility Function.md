Summary:  Continuity of preferences are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a (continuous) utility function  

## <span class="teal-text"> Lexicographic Preferences  </span> 

Define $x \ge y$ if either $x_{1} > y_{1}$ or $x_{1} = y_{1}$ &  $x_{2} \ge y_{2}$  
* Good 1 has the highest priority in determining the preference ordering. When the level of first commodity in two commodity bundles is the same, the amount of the second commodity in the two bundles determines the consumer's preferences. 
* It is rational (complete, transitive), strongly monotone and strictly convex. 
* Lexicographic preferences are not continuous. 
* Cannot be expressed by utility functions. 
* No two unique consumption bundles are indifferent (<span class="orange-text"> ! Because it's no longer about the combinations of two goods that provide the same utility; we always have strict inequalities between the goods </span>)  $\implies$ <u>Indifference curves are singletons. </u>
	* <span class="red-text">!So what?? </span>


## <span class = "teal-text">Utility Function</span>
* Prop 3.C.1: Continuous rational preferences => $\exists$ continuous utility function $u(x)$
* Differentiability is an additional assumption for convenience 
Leontif preferences are represented by non differentiable preferences 
### <span class = "teal-text">Continuity</span> 
When are rational preferences continuous??: 
* Preference relations are preserved in limit. No arbitrary jumps. 
	* Let {$x^{n}$} & {$y^{n}$} to be two sequences
	* If $x^{n} \geq y^{n}  \forall n \implies x= lim_{n\to\infty}(x^{n}) \geq y = lim_{n\to\infty}(y^{n})$,  
		i.e. if for every corresponding element in sequence {y^n}, the element is {x^n} is preferred then, it should be so when n approaches infinity too. 
		There cant be arbitrary jumps. 
		Lexicographic preferences are not continuous because say in two consumption bundles, good 1> good 2 until good 1= good2, and then  good 2> good1. So the preference ordering between the two consumption bundles change.
		Example: 1: {$x^{n}$} = (1/n, 0); {$y^{n}$} = (0,1) 
* Upper contour and lower contour sets are closed.  
	* Upper contour set ($y \in X, y \geq x$)
	* Lower contour set ($y \in X, x  \geq y$)
	* These sets are closed: i.e. contain their limits - the edge points.

## <span class = "teal-text">Properties of Utility Functions </span>

* $u(x)$ is increasing (by monotonicity of preferences)
* $u(.)$ is quasi-concave (as preferences are convex); strict convexity of preferences -> strict quasi-concavity
