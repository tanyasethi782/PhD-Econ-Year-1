Expenditure Function is concave in prices. 

Intuition: 
The p.x line is the line that is linear in p. As p increased and when consumer cannot change x, px would increase. 

But when consumer can change x (as in the EMP), the expenditure would be less than or equal to the straight line px making the expenditure function concave. 


Proof:

Q: In the EMP, we are minimizing the expenditure, then why is the expenditure function concave?

Ah, the expenditure minimization problem (EMP) and the expenditure function â€“ a classic mix that often causes a bit of confusion, so you're in good company!

Let's break it down. In the EMP, the goal is to minimize the cost of achieving a certain utility level given prices. It seems intuitive to think, "If we're minimizing something, shouldn't the function be convex?" ==But here's the twist: the expenditure function is concave in prices, not in the quantity of goods.==

Why, you ask? Because the expenditure function reflects the lowest cost necessary to achieve a certain utility level for different price levels. When prices change, the consumer adjusts their consumption to maintain the same level of utility. This adjustment in response to price changes is what makes the expenditure function concave in prices.

Imagine this: You have two sets of prices for the same bundle of goods that give you the same utility. If you take a weighted average of these two price sets, the theory of convex preferences tells us that you can achieve the same utility at a total cost that's no greater than the weighted average of the costs at the original prices. This is due to the substitutability of goods and the ability to optimize consumption choices.

In short, the concavity of the expenditure function in prices is a reflection of the consumer's ability to substitute between goods efficiently when prices change, thereby minimizing expenditure. It's a bit counterintuitive at first glance, but it's all about the relationship between prices and expenditure, not the minimization process itself.
