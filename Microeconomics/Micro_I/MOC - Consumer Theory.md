Info: There are two approaches to study consumer theory: choice based approach and preference based approach 

See [[Consumer Theory Summary]]


________
# <span class="dark-mustard-text">1) Choice Based Approach </span>
Use actual choices to extrapolate preferences using WARP 
### Consumption Set 

* This is the physically feasible set of consumption. 
* It is convex i.e. if x and $\bar{x}$ are in the consumption set, then their linear combination is in the consumption set as well. 
### Competitive/Walrasian Budgets 

* Set of all feasible consumption bundles for the consumer who faces prices p and has wealth w
* It is convex i.e. if x and $\bar{x}$ are in the consumption set, then their linear combination is in the consumption set as well. 

Assumptions: 
* All the commodities have a publicly attached prices. 
* All the consumers are price takers.

# <span class="dark-mustard-text"> 2) Preference Based Approach </span>

Preferences --> Utility --> UMP/EMP --> Choices (x(p,w) or h(p,u)) 

## [[Preferences]]
Key Assumptions: 
* Monotonicity 
* Convexity 
##  [[Utility Function]] 
* Continuity of preferences are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a (continuous) utility function 
## [[Utility Maximization Problem]] 
* Utility maximization subject to constraints of the walrasian budget set (UMP) 
* Walrasian Demand Correspondence: Consumer's Optimal Choice 
* Indirect Utility Function: Consumer's Optimal Utility Value 
## [[Expenditure Minimization Problem]]
* Hicksian/ Compensated Demand Correspondence 
* Expenditure Function 
* R/p b/w the EMP and the UMP 

## [[Duality]]
* Shephard's Lemma
* Slutsky 
* Roy's Identity

## [[Integrability Problem]] 
* How and when we can recover consumer's underlying preferences from her demand behavior 
* Necessary implications of preference maximizing behavior are also sufficient
