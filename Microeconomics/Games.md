* what additions might “resolve” the ==Bertrand Paradox== (i.e. the surprising answer from thinking about Nash equilibrium with price competition)

*  embed price competition into a spatially extended market and find equilibrium locations. You can try thinking about it first, and then get some help from the ppt on Bertrand competition in Handouts.
### Spatially extended Market 
* This is a shipping problem [[
]]* let Firm 1 locate at x1 and Firm 2 at x2, both in a linear market with a uniform density of consumers each willing to buy 1 unit from the cheaper seller. Sellers deliver the good, competition is in delivered prices.
* ==As we’ll show, price competition at each location leads to equilibrium prices (for duopoly)== ❓

#### Solution
	max {|x-x1|,|x-x2|} and demand is addressed to the more efficient (closer) firm at each location, so serving cost is min {|x-x1|,|x-x2|}  
	
	From this you can find equilibrium profits as a function of locations. You can then do the following:
	
	So now look for a location equilibrium given these prices.
	
	What is surprising about the result, and what are the economics behind it?
	
	The above has profits as trapezoids; you can consider non-linear transport costs if you wish.

### Repeated Games 
which also melds into the next topic; repeated games and trigger strategies and other neat stuff of economic crime and punishment

# Hotelling Model 

* Spatial competition in a “shopping” model and a template for studying product choice / location.

* Whether the market provides goods when it should. Monopoly analysis first, then Monopolistic Competition.

* Ppt: 210304b; where you’ll also find the Circle model (we can sort it quickly because we will have already figured out what’s in the motor from the Hotelling model!

Then I’ll cover the CES model – it’s been the mainstay of International Trade since 2003! So we’ll cover it in the context of product diversity. So **p ls review consumer theory of CES from 7010** for this!
