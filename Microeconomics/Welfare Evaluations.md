Welfare analysis: Evaluation of the effects of changes in the consumer's environment on her well-being. (focus here on change in price)
* Uses preference based approach 

Assumption: 
* Rational, Continuous and locally non satiated preferences 

Problem: Evaluate the impact on the consumer's welfare of a change of prices from $p^0$ to $p^1$. The wealth is assumed to be FIXED at $w$. 
## <span class = "teal-text"> Money-metric indirect utility functions:  </span>

Any indirect utility functions can be used to evaluate welfare differences, this function lets you evaluate welfare changes in $ terms. 

*Why just indirect utility functions and not utility function? Because former is in terms of prices and latter is not. v(p,w) and u(x)*

Start with v(.,.) $\rightarrow$ Choose $\bar{p}$ $\rightarrow$ Consider $e(\bar{p}, v(p,w))$ : Wealth required to reach the utility level $v(p,w)$ when the prices are $\bar{p}$ and is thus itself an indirect utility function. 


** These concepts make me much more sense graphically and following class notes ** 


## EV 

EV = $e(p^0, u^1) - e(p^0, u^0)$
In this formula,  gives you the amount of money you'd need at the original prices to reach the utility level after the price change

  gives you the amount of money you'd need at the original prices  to reach the original utility level.
  
   The difference between these two amounts represents the equivalent variation, ==which tells you how much extra money you would need at the original prices to be as well off as you are after the price change.== It's a way to measure the change in well-being in terms of money, holding the price constant at the initial level.
