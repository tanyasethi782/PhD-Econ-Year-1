# Pareto Optimal: 
No other feasible allocation is possible such that utility is from this allocation is greater for all consumers// Impossible to make one consumer better off without making another worse off 


PO Allocation $\centernot\implies$  Equitable allocation 
PO Allocation $\implies$ there is no waste of resources in the society 


##  Weak Pareto Optimal 
No other allocation exists that makes everyone strictly better off 
## Strong Pareto Optimal 
No other allocation exists st. atleast one person becomes better off and others are not made worse 


By definition, SPO $\implies$ WPO. : If atleast one person can not be made better off, everyone can also not be made better off.
