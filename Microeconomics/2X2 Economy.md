* <span class="dark-mustard-text">Central Question: Equilibrium in the factor market (prices and allocations of factors of production!) </span>
<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>
## Set Up 

* Firm $j$: $(j=2)$
	* Produces Consumer Good $q_j$ 
	* L=2 Factors of production $z_j = (z_{1j}...z_{lj})$
		* Factor 1: labor 
		* Factor 2: K 
	* Concave, Strictly Increasing, differentiable production function $f_j(z_j)$
		* Production function is HD-1, $\implies$ CRS 
* Consumer $i$:
	* Owns Endowments $(\bar{z_1},...,\bar{z_l})$
* Prices 
	* World prices of consumption good are <u>fixed</u> (the small economy is a price-taker)
* Cost 
	* $w=(w_1, w_2)$: Factor prices 
	* $c_j(w)$: Minimum cost of producing one unit of good $j$
	* $a_j(w)$: The input combination at which the minimum cost is achieved 
<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #00FFFF; margin: 10px 0;"></div>
## Tools 
* Unit Isoquant of firm j: {$(z_{1j}, z_{2j}) \in R^2_+: f_j(z_{1j}, z_{2j})$} 
* 1$ Isoquant: Isoquant that produces $1 worth of good. Unit Isoquant/Price
* Isocost Line: {$(w_1,w_2): c_j(w_1,w_2)= \bar{c}$}
	* Downward sloping to keep the cost constant

## Efficient Factor Allocations

<span class="dark-mustard-text">In the edgeworth box, we show two firms and their isoquants. The axis shows the factors used by the firms. </span>

* Fig 15.D.2a: Any output in the shaded region shows higher output for both the firms. 
* Fig 15.D.2b: <span class="dark-mustard-text">Pareto Set of Factor Allocations</span> - Set of factor allocations at which it is not possible, with the total given total factor endowments, to produce more of one good without producing less of the other.
* The pareto set <u>must lie all above or all below or be coincident with the diagonal of the edgeworth box. </u> 
	* This is because if it cuts the diagonal, then because of CRS, all the isoquants would be coincident with the diagonal.

## Competitive Equilibrium 
* <span class="dark-mustard-text">Assumption:  Different Factor Intensities</span>
	* Production of good 1 is relatively more intensive in factor 1 than is the production of good 2 if: 
     $$\frac{a_{11}(w)}{a_{21}(w)} > \frac{a_{12}(w)}{a_{22}(w)} \forall w = (w_1, w_2)$$
	i.e. !!!
* Specialized vs Non Specialized Equilibrium 
	* Specialized Equilibrium: Only one good is produced (read more on this)
	* Non Specialized/ Interior Equilibrium: Production levels of two goods are strictly positive

* Finding Equilibrium factor prices ($w_1, w_2$): 
	
	$$c_1(w_1, w_2) = p_1;   c_2(w_1, w_2) = p_2$$
	* In interior equilibrium, prices equal to unit cost. Because of CRS, this is independent of output levels $q_1, q_2,..$
	*  The two curves intersect at $w_1*, w_2*$
	* Because of factor intensity assumption, curve for firm 2 is flatter than that of firm 1 $\implies$ under the above assumption, at most one equilibrium 

* Finding equilibrium output:
