## Summary
 
 * Hicksian/ Compensated Demand Correspondence 
* Expenditure Function 
* R/p b/w the EMP and the UMP

Ques: Does EMP come from the choice based theory or there is no connection with it? 
	I think not because it is only another way to find the same thing. But I am not sure. Let's read this and figure out.

## <span class = "teal-text">EMP  </span>

* Key problem:  *Min p.x s.t. u(x) $\geq$ u*  

* R/p b/w UMP and EMP: 
	* x* in the UMP for w>0 $\implies$ x* in the EMP when the required u=u(x*)
	* x* in the EMP for u>u(0) $\implies$ x* in the UMP when p.x* = w 

	* e(p, v(p, w)) = w 
	* v(p, e(p, u)) = u

	* h(p,u) = x(p, e(p,u)) 
	* x(p,w) = h(p, v(p,w))

## <span class = "teal-text">Expenditure Function   </span>

e(p,u)

* To find e(p,u) = p.x* (x* is the optimal x)
* Properties: 
	* HD-1 in p 
			e($\alpha$p, u) = $\alpha$ p.x*
	* Strictly increasing in u and non decreasing in p(x) for any item x
	* Concave in p ([[Concavity of expenditure function]])
	* Continuous in p & u

## <span class = "teal-text">Hicksian or Compensated Demand Function   </span>

h(p,u) 
* It is the set of optimal commodity bundles in the EMP
* h(p,u) = x(p, e(p,u)) : *As prices rises, h(.) gives the value of demand that would arise if the expenditure is increased to keep u constant.* This is why it is called the compensated demand function. (This is the Hicksian Wealth Compensation!)
* Properties: 
	* HD-0 in p: *h($\alpha$ p, u) = h(p,u)*
	* No excess utility 
	* $\geq$ is convex  $\implies$ h(p,u) is a convex set 
	*  $\geq$ is strictly convex $\implies$ u(.) is strictly quasiconcave $\implies$ h(p,u) is a singleton 

* <span class = "orange-text">It satisfies the compensated law of demand</span>: demand and price move in opposite direction for price changes accompanied by the Hicksian Wealth Compensation.

## Shephard's Lemma

Demand for a good (given prices and utility level) = derivative of the expenditure function w.r.t price of the good 

$h(p,u) = \frac{\partial e(p,u)}{\partial p}$

Proof (from wikipedia):

^ this is also how you would set up the constraint for the EMP

**Increasing means that every element is greater than the one before it.**Â 
**Non-decreasing means that no element is less than the element before it**, or in other words: that every element is greater than or equal to the one before it.
